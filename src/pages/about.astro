      <h1>Meet Arturo & [ENSO]</h1>

      <p class="mt-8">
        Hello! I'm Arturo, the photographer behind Madrid Amor. But my story isn't just about
        Madrid — it's also about Korea. I lived in Seoul for two years, studied at Korea University
        (고려대학교), and worked at the Spanish Embassy in Korea. Those years gave me a deep love
        for Korean culture, and when I came back to Madrid, I knew I wanted to create something
        special for Korean couples visiting my city.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's why I work together with [ENSO], [ENSO_ROL_DESCRIPCION]. [ENSO_BACKGROUND].
        When you reach out to Madrid Amor, [ENSO] is the person you'll be talking to — she makes
        sure everything feels easy and comfortable from your very first message.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, we bridge two worlds. I bring the photography, the knowledge of Madrid's most
        beautiful spots, and the golden Spanish light. [ENSO] brings [ENSO_CUALIDADES].
        We're not just a photography service — we're your friends in Madrid.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we're not preparing for photoshoots, you'll find us exploring Madrid's hidden gems —
        from secret rooftop terraces to quiet plazas that most tourists never discover. These are
        the places we love to share with the couples we photograph.

      <h2>Why Madrid?</h2>

      <p class="mt-8">
        Madrid isn't just Spain's capital — it's a city that breathes romance. With over 300 days
        of sunshine per year, the famous Spanish light creates a warm, golden glow that photographers
        dream of.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the grandeur of the Royal Palace to the charming streets of Malasaña, from the tranquil
        gardens of Retiro Park to the dramatic sunset views at Temple of Debod — Madrid offers an
        incredible diversity of backdrops for your love story. And because Arturo knows every corner
        of this city — and [ENSO] knows exactly what Korean couples love — we'll plan a route that
        feels both authentically Madrid and perfectly you.
